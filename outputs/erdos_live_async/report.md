# Research Report: Hidden-dependency mapping across Erdos combinatorics conjectures

**Project ID:** `erdos-combo-001`

## Overarching problem

Map the hidden dependency structures shared by open Erdos problems in graph Ramsey theory and additive combinatorics, with emphasis on which assumptions trigger recurring lemmas, which perturbations shift the apparent provability boundary, and which formalizations expose reusable infrastructure across the family.
